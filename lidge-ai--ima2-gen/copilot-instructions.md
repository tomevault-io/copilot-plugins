# ima2-gen — AI Context

<!-- runtime-install:generated:start -->
| Contract | Value |
|---|---|
| Node engine | `>=22` |
| npm toolchain | `npm@11.18.0` |
| Release Node | `24.17.0` |
| CLI entry | `bin/ima2.js` |
| OpenAI SDK | `^7.4.0` |
| Express | `^5.1.0` |
<!-- runtime-install:generated:end -->

Runtime installation metadata is generated from `package.json` and `.node-version`; source TypeScript users must build before running emitted JavaScript.

## What This Project Does
Local image generation studio — CLI + 웹 UI
- GPT OAuth, API Key, Grok, Gemini API, Antigravity CLI 다중 provider 지원
- 텍스트→이미지, 이미지→이미지(편집), 비디오 생성
- SSE 멀티플렉싱: 단일 `GET /api/events` SSE 채널 + async POST (202) 아키텍처
- 병렬 생성 (최대 12건, 브라우저 연결 포화 없음)

## Tech Stack
- Runtime: Node.js ES Module; package engine is shown in the generated table above
- Server: Express 5
- API Client: OpenAI SDK range is rendered in the runtime-install contract above
- GPT OAuth: in-process Codex backend client (`lib/codexBackend`); GPT-6 plans, gpt-image-2 renders
- Grok: xAI OAuth (device code) 또는 API key, api.x.ai 직접 호출
- Gemini: Google Generative Language API / Vertex AI
- Frontend: React + Vite (`ui/src`, built to `ui/dist`)
- SSE: lib/eventBus.ts (ring buffer pub/sub) + routes/events.ts

## Agent Skills (packaged)

Three Markdown skill files ship inside `skills/` for AI coding agents:

| Skill | Path | CLI | What It Covers |
|-------|------|-----|----------------|
| Core | `skills/ima2/SKILL.md` | `ima2 skill` | CLI reference, prompting protocol, provider routing, video workflows |
| Frontend | `skills/ima2-front/SKILL.md` | `ima2 skill front` | Asset pipeline, motion/video, responsive, a11y, anti-slop, 28 reference files |
| UI/UX Design | `skills/ima2-uiux/SKILL.md` | `ima2 skill uiux` | Image-first ism discovery, UX states, design-isms, product personalities, 18 reference files |

Use `ima2 skill ls` to list, `ima2 skill <name> path` for file paths,
`ima2 skill <name> --json` for JSON-wrapped content. Reference modules
inside `front` and `uiux` skills are loadable individually:

```bash
ima2 skill front refs              # list reference modules with line counts
ima2 skill front ref anti-slop     # load one module by name
ima2 skill uiux ref design-isms    # load a uiux module
ima2 skill install --dir <path>     # install to agent's skill directory
ima2 skill install --tmp            # install to temp dir (ephemeral fallback)
```

**Recommended approach:** The agent resolves its own skill directory path and runs
`ima2 skill install --dir <path>`. Skills land on disk as directories (SKILL.md +
references/) and the agent reads them natively. Avoid piping large bundled outputs.

## Devlog Phase Roadmap
- Current active plans live under `devlog/_plan/`.
- Completed plans live under `devlog/_fin/`.
- Legacy phase docs live under `devlog/_plan/_legacy/`.
- Use `structure/07-devlog-map.md` and `devlog/_plan/README.md` as the current roadmap references.

## Conventions
- ES Module only (import/export)
- File length < 500 lines (split if exceeded)
- Function length < 50 lines
- Wrap async work in try/catch only where the error is transformed, logged, or surfaced at a boundary (route handler, job runner, CLI entry). A catch that only rethrows is noise; let the error propagate.
- Config values in config.js or .env, never hardcode

## Pull requests
- PRs that change files under `ui/` (except `ui/e2e/**` and `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*`
  files), `public/`, or an image under `assets/` must embed a screenshot of the
  UI change in the PR description. The `screenshot-gate` check
  (`pull_request_target`, `.github/scripts/pr-screenshot.cjs`) re-runs on
  description edits until the image is present.
- Never commit screenshot evidence to a PR branch — it rides the merge into the
  integration branch. Drag the image into the description editor, or, when
  uploading from the CLI as an agent with push access, commit it to the orphan
  `pr-assets` branch (one directory per PR or date slug) and link by commit SHA:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lidge-ai/ima2-gen/<sha>/<pr-or-date-slug>/<name>.png`.
- A maintainer waives the gate with the `ui-screenshot-waived` label (must be
  applied by someone with write/admin permission) or a comment stating the
  change does not touch the UI.

## Test Command
```bash
npm run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit (server + lib)
npm run typecheck:tests    # tsc --noEmit (test files)
npm run lint               # ESLint + typescript-eslint (type-aware) over server/lib/routes/bin/scripts/ui/src/desktop
npm test                   # scripts/run-tests.mjs canonical node:test runner
npm run test:inventory     # verify test file registry
cd ui && npm run build     # Vite production build
```

## CI Layout
- PRs run only the minimal `PR fast gate` contract (`pr-fast.yml`, Ubuntu-only; docs/devlog-only PRs skip the backend/frontend jobs via a `changes` filter). Do not add Windows/macOS legs to it.
- Cross-platform CI is post-merge: pushes to `dev`/`main`/`preview` run the full `CI` workflow, the Agy filesystem matrix, and the unsigned macOS desktop build (path-filtered so docs-only pushes stay green).
- A red `dev` run is fixed forward on `dev`; details in CONTRIBUTING.md `## CI`.

## Heartbeat
- 20분마다 devlog/_plan 점검 및 다음 작업 제안
- 완료된 phase는 _fin/으로 이동 (YYMMDD_ prefix)
