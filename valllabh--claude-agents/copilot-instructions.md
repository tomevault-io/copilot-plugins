## Agent Capabilities

Enhanced agents include sophisticated workflows with:
- Interactive elicitation (1-9 numbered options)
- Sequential task execution with validation
- Template-driven document generation
- Comprehensive quality assurance processes
- Brownfield project support
- AI-optimized workflows

## Testing Workflow

1. **Navigate to test project**:
   ```bash
   cd test-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   claude init
   ```

3. **Copy agents to test project**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ../agents .claude/
   ```

4. **Copy usage documentation**:
   ```bash
   cp ../AGENT-USAGE-GUIDE.md .
   ```

5. **Invoke agents in optimal sequence**:

   - Create frontend specifications and accessibility audits
   - Commands: `design-wireframe`, `design-ui`, `ai-ui-prompt`

4. **System Architect (Winston)** 🏗️
   - Design system architecture and infrastructure
   - Select technologies and create ADRs
   - Commands: `design-system`, `select-technology`, `design-api`

### Phase 3: Development Planning
5. **Product Owner (Sarah)** 📝
   - Refine backlog and create user stories
   - Plan sprints and define acceptance criteria
   - Commands: `refine-backlog`, `create-story`, `plan-sprint`

6. **Scrum Master (Bob)** 🏃

   - Commands: `develop-story`, `debug`, `refactor`

8. **QA Engineer (Quinn)** 🧪
   - Perform senior code review and refactoring
   - Design comprehensive testing strategies
   - Commands: `review-code`, `refactor`, `test-strategy`

## Agent Coordination Principles

- **Sequential Flow**: Follow the numbered sequence for new projects
- **Iterative Loops**: Return to earlier phases as needed for refinement
- **Parallel Work**: UX Expert and System Architect can work in parallel after initial planning
- **Handoff Quality**: Each agent prepares clear outputs for the next phase
- **Continuous Validation**: Product Owner and Scrum Master validate throughout
