# LLM Wiki Schema

> This is the authoritative schema document. The LLM must follow these conventions when maintaining the wiki. Treat this as the system prompt for wiki operations.

## Mission

Build and maintain a persistent, compounding knowledge base. The wiki is not a dump of raw text—it is a structured, interlinked artifact that grows richer with every source. Cross-references are pre-built. Contradictions are flagged. Synthesis reflects everything read so far.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Raw sources are immutable.** The LLM never edits files in `raw/`. Ever.
2. **The LLM owns the wiki layer.** All markdown files under `wiki/` are created, updated, and maintained by the LLM unless explicitly overridden by the operator.
3. **Every action is logged.** Every ingest, query result filed, and lint pass appends an entry to `wiki/log.md`.
4. **The index is always current.** `wiki/index.md` must reflect the state of the wiki after every operation that touches pages.
5. **Cross-references are first-class.** Every page must link to related pages. Orphan pages are bugs.

## Page Types & Conventions

### Entity Pages (`wiki/entities/`)

- Filename: `kebab-case.md`
- Purpose: A concrete thing that appears across multiple sources.
- Frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: entity
  aliases: ["Alternative Name", "Abbreviation"]
  tags: [tag-one, tag-two]
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  source_count: 0
  ---
  ```
- Sections:
  - `# Entity Name` — H1 title, exact canonical name.
  - `## Identity` — What it is, one concise paragraph.
  - `## Aliases` — List of known aliases.
  - `## Key Attributes` — Structured facts (table or bullet list).
  - `## Evidence` — Links to source summaries that mention this entity, with brief quote or context per link.
  - `## Related` — Links to related entity and concept pages.
  - `## Open Questions` — Uncertainties or gaps about this entity.

### Concept Pages (`wiki/concepts/`)

- Filename: `kebab-case.md`
- Purpose: An abstract idea, theory, or methodology.
- Frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: concept
  aliases: ["Synonym", "Related Term"]

  - `## Contrasts` — Differences from related concepts.
  - `## Evidence` — Source links with context.
  - `## Related` — Cross-links.
  - `## Open Questions`

### Source Pages (`wiki/sources/`)

- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD--source-title-slug.md`
- Purpose: Summary and extraction from a single raw source.
- Frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: source
  source_path: raw/sources/original-filename.pdf
  title: "Exact Title of Source"
  author: "Author Name"
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  tags: [tag-one, tag-two]
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  ---
  ```
- Sections:
  - `# Source Title`
  - `## Summary` — 3-5 sentence overview.
  - `## Key Claims` — Numbered list of main assertions.
  - `## Notable Quotes` — Direct quotes with page/section references if available.
  - `## Entities Mentioned` — Links to entity pages created or updated.
  - `## Concepts Mentioned` — Links to concept pages.
  - `## Follow-ups` — Questions or leads from this source.

### Synthesis Pages (`wiki/syntheses/`)

- Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD--question-slug.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD--topic-slug.md`
- Purpose: Cross-source analysis, answers to questions, comparisons.
- Frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  type: synthesis
  question: "The exact question this page answers"
  tags: [tag-one, tag-two]
  created: YYYY-MM-DD
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  ---
  ```
- Sections:
  - `# Synthesis Title`
  - `## Question / Purpose`
  - `## Answer / Analysis`
  - `## Comparison Table` (if applicable)
  - `## Citations` — Links to source pages with brief evidence snippets.
  - `## Implications` — Why this matters.
  - `## Follow-up Questions`

## Citation Rules

1. Every claim in a wiki page must cite at least one source page or synthesis page.
2. Use Obsidian wikilink syntax: `[[Page Name]]` or `[[Page Name|display text]]`.
3. In source pages, cite the raw source file path in `source_path` frontmatter.
4. When updating a page based on a new source, append the new citation—do not remove old ones unless they are factually incorrect.

## Ingest Workflow

**Goal:** Integrate a new raw source into the wiki.

**Preconditions:**
- Source file exists in `raw/sources/` or `raw/assets/`.
- The operator has requested ingestion.

**Steps:**
1. Read the raw source. If the source references images, read them separately after reading the text.
2. Discuss key takeaways with the operator. Summarize the main points. Ask what to emphasize, what connections to draw, what to prioritize. This is a conversation, not a report — the operator's judgment shapes what gets extracted and how it's framed.
3. Write a source summary page in `wiki/sources/`.
4. Update or create entity pages in `wiki/entities/` for any concrete things mentioned.
5. Update or create concept pages in `wiki/concepts/` for any abstract ideas mentioned.
6. Update `wiki/index.md` with new and updated pages.
7. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md`.

**Done Criteria:**
- Source page exists and is complete.
- All entities and concepts mentioned have pages (new or updated).
- `wiki/index.md` reflects all changes.
- `wiki/log.md` has a new entry.

## Query Workflow

**Goal:** Answer a question using the wiki as the primary knowledge source.

**Steps:**
1. Read `wiki/index.md` to find relevant pages.
2. Read relevant entity, concept, source, and synthesis pages.
3. Synthesize an answer with citations (wikilinks to pages used). Answers can take different forms: a markdown page, a comparison table, a slide deck (Marp), a chart (matplotlib), or a canvas. Choose the format that best fits the question.
4. Present the answer to the operator.
5. If the answer is reusable or represents new synthesis, file it as a new synthesis page in `wiki/syntheses/` and update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md`.

**Done Criteria:**
- Answer is supported by cited wiki pages.
- If filed, synthesis page exists and is linked from index and log.

## Lint Workflow

**Goal:** Health-check the wiki for structural and logical issues.

**Checks:**
1. **Contradictions:** Claims on different pages that conflict.
2. **Stale Claims:** Assertions newer sources have superseded.
3. **Orphan Pages:** Pages with no inbound wikilinks.
4. **Missing Pages:** Important concepts mentioned but lacking dedicated pages.
5. **Broken Links:** Wikilinks pointing to non-existent pages.
6. **Data Gaps:** Areas where additional sources or web search could fill holes.

**Steps:**
1. Scan all pages for the above issues.
2. Produce a lint report (can be a temporary synthesis page or inline in chat).
3. Discuss fixes with the operator.
4. Apply agreed fixes.
5. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md`.

**Done Criteria:**
- Report lists all found issues with severity.
- Agreed fixes are applied.
- `wiki/log.md` updated.

## Update Rules for Special Files

### `wiki/index.md`

- Append-only for new pages.
- Modify existing entries when pages are updated (change `updated` date and summary if needed).
- Group by: Entities, Concepts, Sources, Syntheses.
- Each entry: `| [[Page Name]] | One-line summary | Source count | Status | Updated |`

### `wiki/log.md`

- Strictly append-only.
- Each entry starts with: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action-type | Brief description`
- Include: action type (ingest/query/lint), pages touched, notes, open questions.

## Frontmatter Contract

Every wiki page must include YAML frontmatter with at minimum:
- `type`: entity | concept | source | synthesis
- `tags`: list of relevant tags
- `created`: ISO date

Optional but recommended:
- `updated`: ISO date
- `source_count`: integer
- `aliases`: list of alternative names

## Operator Communication Style

- When ingesting, summarize what was done and what pages were touched.
- When querying, cite sources and offer to file reusable answers.
- When linting, present findings with severity and suggested fixes.
- Always ask before making large structural changes.

## Schema Evolution

This document is co-evolved with the operator. If a workflow isn't working, propose a change here before changing behavior.

## Why This Works

The tedious part of maintaining a knowledge base is not the reading or the thinking — it's the bookkeeping. Updating cross-references, keeping summaries current, noting contradictions, maintaining consistency across dozens of pages. Humans abandon wikis because the maintenance burden grows faster than the value. LLMs don't get bored, don't forget to update a cross-reference, and can touch 15 files in one pass. The wiki stays maintained because the cost of maintenance is near zero.

The idea is related in spirit to Vannevar Bush's Memex (1945) — a personal, curated knowledge store with associative trails between documents. Private, actively curated, with the connections between documents as valuable as the documents themselves. The part Bush couldn't solve was who does the maintenance. The LLM handles that.
