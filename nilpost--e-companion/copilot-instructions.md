## Session files — read all three at session start

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Stack, conventions, agent registry (this file) |
| `STATUS.md` | Current sprint, in-progress items, blockers, decisions log |
| `BACKLOG.md` | All tasks P0 (blocking) → P3 (someday) |

**PO agent**: reads all three + `git log --oneline -10` before doing anything. Updates `STATUS.md` and `BACKLOG.md` and commits them at end of session.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Backend | Express.js + Node.js (ESM modules) |
| Real-time | WebSockets (ws) |
| Auth | Passport.js — session-based (not JWT) |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Supabase |
| Hosting | Railway — auto-deploys from `main` branch |
| DNS / CDN | Cloudflare — `companion.postiusgroup.com` |

## Database

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Provider | Supabase |
| Project ref | `ynegbxsokzonsjrandyi` |
| Region | AWS ap-northeast-1 |
| Schema file | `shared/schema.ts` |
| Migration style | Push-based (`npx drizzle-kit push`) — no migration files |
| Runtime connection | `DATABASE_URL` env var |
| Migration connection | `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` env var (Supavisor session-mode pooler, port 5432) |

---

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Supabase connection string (pooled) |
| `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` | migrations only | Supavisor **session-mode** pooler (`...pooler.supabase.com:5432`) — use for `drizzle-kit push`. Session mode supports session-level DDL and is IPv4-safe for Railway; the direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432` endpoint is IPv6-only and fails from Railway. **As of 2026-07-21, `drizzle.config.ts` code reads this correctly (PR #14), but the value itself still needs to be set in Railway's service variables — see STATUS.md blockers / BACKLOG.md INFRA-06.** |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes | Passport session secret — must be long random string in prod |
| `NODE_ENV` | yes | `production` on Railway, `development` locally |
| `PORT` | no | Railway sets this automatically; defaults to 5000 locally |

Never hardcode these. Never commit `.env`.

---

## Build & deploy

```bash
# Install (Railway uses this — includes devDeps needed for build)
npm install --include=dev

# Build (Vite for client + esbuild for server)
npm run build

# Start (production)
npm run start

# Local dev
npm run dev
```

**Railway specifics**:
- Auto-deploys on push to `main`
- `nixpacks.toml` overrides install to `npm install --include=dev`
- Node 18 on Railway — do NOT use `import.meta.dirname` (Node 21+ only)
- Use `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` or `process.cwd()` instead

**Verifying a deploy went live**: Claude Code web/agent sessions run behind an outbound network allowlist that does NOT include `companion.postiusgroup.com` by default — `curl`/`WebFetch` to the live URL will 403 at the proxy, not at the app. Don't report this as "site is down"; report it as "cannot verify from this sandbox" and ask the human to check the Railway dashboard, or to widen the session's network policy (see https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) if live verification is needed repeatedly.

## Postmortems / Learnings

> Durable lessons from real incidents. Add an entry when a bug reveals a pattern likely to recur — not for routine fixes.

- **2026-07-17 — Unhandled promise rejections crash the whole process (BUG-01 / HARDEN-01)**: Any `async` Express handler (route handler, or a callback library like `passport-local` that doesn't await/catch its callback) whose rejection is never caught becomes an unhandled promise rejection. Node exits on this by default, and Railway's `ON_FAILURE` restart policy then serves 502s to *every* user until it restarts — not just the one request that failed. Fix pattern: never leave an `async` callback unguarded.
  - `server/auth.ts`: passport callbacks (`LocalStrategy` verify, `deserializeUser`) now wrap their bodies in try/catch and resolve errors via `done(err)`.
  - `server/routes.ts`: all route handlers go through the `asyncHandler` wrapper (top of file), which forwards rejections to `next(err)` → the global error middleware in `server/index.ts`. **Any new route added to this file must use `asyncHandler`.**
  - General rule: a raw `async (req, res) => {...}` route handler with no `asyncHandler`/try-catch is a bug, not a style choice.
- **2026-07-21 — Docs can describe env-var wiring that the code never implements (ENV-01)**: `AGENTS.md`/`BOOTSTRAP.md` documented `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` as "the migration connection," but `drizzle.config.ts` only ever read `DATABASE_URL` — so every `drizzle-kit push` silently ran through the Supabase pooler, and the docs were describing an intent, not a fact. Same audit also found `SESSION_SECRET` read via a `!` non-null assertion (crashes with a cryptic express-session error on a missing var) instead of the fail-fast guard pattern already used for `DATABASE_URL` in `server/db.ts`. Fixed in PR #14. General rule: when a config table in AGENTS.md names a specific env var for a specific purpose, treat that as a claim to verify against the actual code path (`grep` for `process.env.<VAR>`), not a fact to take on faith — doc and code drift silently because nothing fails loudly when a fallback (the pooler, a stale assertion) papers over the gap. `infra-admin`/`devops` env-var audits should grep for each documented var's actual usage site, not just its presence in `.env.example`.

- **2026-07-21 — Supabase's direct DB host is IPv6-only; Railway needs the pooler (BUG-03)**: This app uses Supabase purely as a Postgres database (Passport.js + Drizzle over `DATABASE_URL` — **not** Supabase Auth, so accounts live in `public.users`, and Supabase's "Authentication → Users" pane is *expected* to be empty). The single point of failure is therefore the `DATABASE_URL` endpoint. Supabase's **direct** connection host `db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432` resolves to **IPv6 only** (no A record); Railway (like Vercel and many PaaS) has no IPv6 egress, so the app boots and shows "Online" while every query silently fails to connect. Signature of this failure, all visible from the Supabase side: `users` has 0 rows, the `connect-pg-simple` `session` table was never auto-created, **no ERROR-level Postgres logs** (nothing reaches the DB), and **no app connections** in `pg_stat_activity`. Fix: use the IPv4 **Supavisor pooler** string — `postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<pw>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres` (port 6543 transaction / 5432 session), exactly as `.env.example` already prescribes. Confirm with DNS: the direct host has no IPv4 A record; the pooler host does. Don't diagnose "cannot create a user" as an app/validation bug before verifying the runtime `DATABASE_URL` actually reaches this DB.
  - Corollary: **don't add RLS/Supabase-Auth machinery to this project.** A manually-added `ensure_rls` event trigger (`public.rls_auto_enable()`) had auto-enabled RLS with zero policies on all 14 tables — harmless only because the `postgres` role has `BYPASSRLS`, but a landmine if the connection role ever changes, and it re-enables RLS on any newly-created table (including `session`). Removed 2026-07-21. The intended model is: trusted DB connection, authorization enforced in Express (`isAuthenticated` + `WHERE user_id = req.user.id`), no per-row DB policies.

---

## Auth conventions

- Session-based via Passport.js — `req.user` is set on authenticated requests
- `isAuthenticated` middleware in `server/auth.ts` — apply to all protected routes
- Auth API routes (no middleware needed): `POST /api/register`, `POST /api/login`, `POST /api/logout`, `GET /api/user`
- All other `/api/*` routes must have `isAuthenticated`
- Always check `WHERE user_id = req.user.id` on queries — users must not access each other's data

---

## Code conventions

- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- All DB queries in `server/storage.ts` — routes call storage functions, nothing else
- API response shape: `{ data: ... }` on success, `{ message: "..." }` on error
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious (not the what)
- No `import.meta.dirname` — use `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` or `process.cwd()`
- No raw SQL strings — use Drizzle query builder

---

## Agent registry

These 9 agents originated in this repo and are now also published as `studio-core` in
[`nilpost/claude-code-studio`](https://github.com/nilpost/claude-code-studio) — a git-hosted
Claude Code plugin marketplace that distributes the same agents (generalized to any stack) to
every other project, plus a shared, incrementally-growing `knowledge/LEARNINGS.md`. This repo
consumes that marketplace via `.claude/settings.json` (`extraKnownMarketplaces` +
`enabledPlugins`), but its own `.claude/agents/*.md` still take priority for E-Companion-specific
behavior — the marketplace copies are the generic fallback everyone else gets. See `po.md`'s
"Learning cycle" for how a lesson decides whether it stays local or goes to the shared base.

| Agent | Model | Trigger — use when... |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| `po` | Sonnet 5 | Starting any goal. Reads session files, orchestrates, updates them on exit. |
| `backlog` | Haiku 4.5 | Adding or refining items in BACKLOG.md |
| `feature-planning` | Sonnet 5 | Designing a feature before any code is written |
| `code-review` | Sonnet 5 | Reviewing a diff or set of changed files before merge |
| `qa` | Haiku 4.5 | Writing tests for a completed scope |
| `devops` | Haiku 4.5 | Diagnosing build failures, deploy issues, env config |
| `infra-admin` | Haiku 4.5 | Auditing Cloudflare, Supabase, Railway, or env var completeness |
| `docs` | Haiku 4.5 | Generating architecture diagrams, API reference, schema docs |
| `security` | Sonnet 5 | OWASP audit, auth review, access control check |

### Invocation examples

```
# Via PO (recommended for multi-step goals)
@po implement feeding reminder CRUD end-to-end

# Direct (for narrow, single-agent tasks)
@feature-planning add health event logging for pets
@code-review review server/routes.ts and server/storage.ts
@qa write tests for the auth flow in server/auth.ts
@devops diagnose why Railway build is failing
@infra-admin audit env vars against .env.example
@docs generate architecture diagram and API reference
@security run full OWASP audit on the API layer
@backlog surface backlog items from the health logging feature
```

### Token optimization rules (all agents follow these)
- Read only files relevant to the task — never scan the full codebase
- Pass file paths to sub-agents, not file contents
- Haiku for mechanical/structured tasks; Sonnet for judgment-heavy tasks
- Parallelize independent tasks (e.g. QA + backlog update after a feature ships)
