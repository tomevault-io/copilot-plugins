If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest Nexus commands AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced Nexus commands. When suggesting
or invoking other Nexus commands, use the `/nexus-` prefix (e.g., `/nexus-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/nexus-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/nexus/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/nexus/nexus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the release-based "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). `/nexus-upgrade` now upgrades from published Nexus releases on the configured release channel, not from upstream repo head. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running Nexus v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present, always include the standardized runtime summary before moving on to work, even when `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `yes`.

When summarizing setup or upgrade state, always keep `REPO_MODE` and `EXECUTION_MODE` separate:
- `REPO_MODE` is repo ownership only, for example `solo` or `collaborative`
- `EXECUTION_MODE` is runtime routing only, either `governed_ccb` or `local_provider`
- Never describe `solo` or `collaborative` as an execution mode
- If `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, say it is the current default derived from machine state, not a saved preference
- `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE` explains whether the active route came from a saved preference or a machine-state default
- `EXECUTION_PATH` is the current effective route, for example `codex-via-ccb`
- `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` tells you whether the chosen route is runnable right now in this host/session
- `REQUIRED_GOVERNED_PROVIDERS` is the governed provider set Nexus needs for the standard dual-audit path
- when `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, also surface `GOVERNED_READY`, `MOUNTED_PROVIDERS`, and `MISSING_PROVIDERS`
- `LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_PATH`, and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` describe the current-host local fallback path

Whenever you summarize setup, upgrade, or first-run state, present runtime status in this order:
- Repo mode: `REPO_MODE`
- Execution mode: `EXECUTION_MODE` plus whether it is a saved preference or a machine-state default (`EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`)
- Execution path: `EXECUTION_PATH`
- Current session ready: `CURRENT_SESSION_READY`
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`: governed ready, mounted providers, missing providers
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` because governed CCB is not ready, explicitly say whether that is because CCB is missing or because mounted providers are incomplete, and include the local fallback path
- Branch: `_BRANCH`
- Proactive: `PROACTIVE`

When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no`, explicitly tell the user whether the gap is:
- CCB not installed (`CCB_AVAILABLE=no`), or
- CCB installed but required providers are not mounted (`MISSING_PROVIDERS` is non-empty)

If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no` and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion before moving into lifecycle work:

> Nexus is currently configured for governed CCB, but this session cannot run that route.
> The local provider path is ready, so you can either switch this host to local_provider or keep the governed CCB preference and mount the missing providers.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A if you want to work now in this host. Choose B only if you intend to mount CCB providers before continuing.
> A) Switch this host to local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Keep governed_ccb and mount the missing CCB providers (human: ~2m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE"
fi
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY"
fi
```
Then explain that future Nexus runs on this host will use `local_provider` until the user changes the saved preference.

If B: do not change Nexus config. Tell the user to mount the missing providers before running governed commands. If CCB is installed but providers are missing, say the standard start path is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude`. If CCB is not installed, say they need to install or restore CCB first.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, state the effective execution mode explicitly using `EXECUTION_MODE`, `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`, and `CCB_AVAILABLE`. Use `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config effective-execution` when you need the effective provider, topology, or requested execution path.
When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, do not ask the user to configure `PRIMARY_PROVIDER` or `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`. Those are local-provider host preferences, not governed CCB config keys.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion to persist the execution preference:

> Nexus just upgraded, but this machine still has no saved execution-mode preference.
> Repo mode only tells you whether the repo is solo or collaborative.
> Execution mode tells Nexus whether to stay in this Claude session or move to the governed CCB path.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B if you want the standard governed Nexus path, because CCB is already installed. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Stay in the current Claude session with local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Persist governed_ccb and use mounted CCB providers (human: ~1m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider claude
```
Then explain that the current session can continue with `local_provider`, and if `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY` is empty the default local topology is `single_agent`. Claude local-provider topologies invoke the local Claude CLI; inside Claude Code they are guarded unless `NEXUS_ALLOW_NESTED_CLAUDE=1` is set.

If B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode governed_ccb
```
Then explain that `governed_ccb` requires active CCB providers for this repo, and that the standard way to start them is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude` if they are not already mounted.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `no`, tell the user Nexus is defaulting to `local_provider` for this host/session. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `no`, say that CCB is not detected. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `yes`, say which providers are mounted and which are still missing. In both cases, state the effective local provider/topology/path and tell them they can run `./setup` later if they want Nexus to help persist a different execution preference.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Nexus Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "Nexus follows the **Completeness Principle** — when the bounded, correct
implementation costs only a little more than the shortcut, prefer finishing the real job."

Then run:

```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

This only happens once.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
Before prompting, treat either the standard `## Nexus Skill Routing` section or any
existing instruction that routes lifecycle work through `/discover` to `/closeout`
as equivalent Nexus routing guidance. If equivalent guidance already exists, skip this entirely.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes canonical Nexus command
> routing guidance. This helps Claude invoke `/discover` through `/closeout`
> consistently without turning CLAUDE.md into a second contract layer.

Options:
- A) Add Nexus invocation guidance to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke Nexus commands manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md only when the file does not already
contain equivalent Nexus routing guidance:

```markdown

## Nexus Skill Routing

When the user's request matches a canonical Nexus command, invoke that command first.
This guidance helps command discovery only.
Contracts, transitions, governed artifacts, and lifecycle truth are owned by `lib/nexus/`
and canonical `.planning/` artifacts.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke discover
- Scope definition, requirements framing, non-goals → invoke frame
- Architecture review, execution readiness, implementation planning → invoke plan
- Governed routing and handoff packaging → invoke handoff
- Bounded implementation execution → invoke build
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke closeout
```

Do not auto-commit the file. After updating `CLAUDE.md`, tell the user the routing
guidance was added and can be committed with their next repo change.

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing guidance later by running `nexus-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any Nexus skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.



## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your Nexus experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** Nexus tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but Nexus failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.nexus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` only when the active provider route allows Codex
  or the user explicitly asks for Codex; in `local_provider` with a non-Codex
  primary, use the host/local subagent path instead
- Writing to `~/.nexus/` (config, review artifacts, design artifacts, learnings, eureka notes)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /nexus

Nexus is the workflow harness. Users should feel like they are moving through:

`/discover -> /frame -> /plan -> /handoff -> /build -> /review -> /qa -> /ship -> /closeout`

Provider routing is substrate, not the primary user workflow.

## Session Bootstrap

When the user enters `/nexus`, begin by summarizing the active runtime route before doing
anything else.

Always report, in this order:
- Repo mode: `REPO_MODE`
- Execution mode: `EXECUTION_MODE`
- Execution mode source: `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`
- Execution path: `EXECUTION_PATH`
- Current session ready: `CURRENT_SESSION_READY`

When governed CCB state is relevant, also report:
- Required governed providers: `REQUIRED_GOVERNED_PROVIDERS`
- Mounted providers: `MOUNTED_PROVIDERS`
- Missing providers: `MISSING_PROVIDERS`
- Governed ready: `GOVERNED_READY`

When local fallback is relevant, also report:
- Local provider candidate: `LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE`
- Local topology: `LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`
- Local execution path: `LOCAL_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_PATH`
- Local provider ready: `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY`

Interpret bootstrap state like this:

- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY=yes`:
  - say Nexus is using governed CCB in this session
  - explicitly list mounted providers
  - if `claude` is mounted in addition to `codex` and `gemini`, say so, but make it clear the standard governed dual-audit path requires `codex` and `gemini`

- If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` and `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE=machine_default_local_ccb_missing`:
  - say CCB is not detected on this machine/session
  - say Nexus is continuing in the current host through `local_provider`
  - state the active local provider and topology

- If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` and `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE=machine_default_local_governed_not_ready`:
  - say CCB exists but is not fully ready for governed execution in this session
  - explicitly list mounted providers and missing providers
  - say Nexus is continuing in the current host through the local fallback path for now

- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY=no`:
  - treat this as an explicit governed preference that is currently blocked
  - say whether the gap is missing CCB entirely or missing governed providers
  - mention the available local fallback path, but do not silently claim the run has switched to it
  - if `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY=yes`, use the preamble's blocked-governed route choice prompt to let the user choose whether to switch this host to `local_provider` or keep `governed_ccb` and mount CCB
  - do not continue into lifecycle work until that route choice is resolved

Do not make the user reason about `execution_mode`, `primary_provider`, or `provider_topology`
before they have even started the lifecycle. Present the substrate summary once, then move
them back to the workflow.

If the user invoked bare `/nexus` with no narrower task, do not default to `/browse`. Give
the bootstrap summary, tell them the canonical starting point is `/discover`, and say that
Nexus will surface the right support skills as the run progresses.

## Lifecycle Routing

If `PROACTIVE` is `false`: do NOT proactively invoke or suggest other Nexus skills during
this session. Only run skills the user explicitly invokes. This preference persists across
sessions via `nexus-config`.

If `PROACTIVE` is `true` (default): invoke the matching Nexus skill instead of answering
inline when the request clearly maps to a canonical stage or support surface.

**Routing rules — when you see these patterns, INVOKE the skill via the Skill tool:**
- New idea, "is this worth building", brainstorming, product ambiguity → invoke `/discover`
- Strategy, scope, non-goals, success criteria, product brief → invoke `/frame`
- Turn scope into an execution-ready plan, architecture readiness, verification path → invoke `/plan`
- Design system, visual identity, brand direction → invoke `/design-consultation`
- Review the design quality of a plan before build → invoke `/plan-design-review`
- Freeze governed routing, provenance intent, fallback policy → invoke `/handoff`
- Execute a bounded implementation contract → invoke `/build`
- Broken behavior, bug, root-cause debugging → invoke `/investigate`
- Governed audit, code review, implementation validation → invoke `/review`
- Complexity cleanup, behavior-preserving refactor, maintainability advisory → invoke `/simplify`
- QA, site testing, bug-finding, validation → invoke `/qa`
- Visual audit or polish of a live site → invoke `/design-review`
- Release readiness, PR gate, merge readiness → invoke `/ship`
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke `/closeout`
- Merge an already-shipped PR without assuming deployment → invoke `/land`
- Deploy and verify an already-landed change → invoke `/deploy`
- Combined merge and deploy shortcut → invoke `/land-and-deploy`
- Update docs after shipping → invoke `/document-release`
- Weekly retro or shipped-work summary → invoke `/retro`
- Performance regression / baseline work → invoke `/benchmark`
- Security review / threat analysis → invoke `/cso`
- Browser-based QA or authenticated browser testing → invoke `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, or `/setup-browser-cookies`
- Safety controls or edit boundaries → invoke `/careful`, `/guard`, `/freeze`, or `/unfreeze`
- Upgrade Nexus itself → invoke `/nexus-upgrade`

If a matching skill exists, do not answer with an ad-hoc explanation first. Route to the
skill. If no skill matches, answer directly.

## Support Surface Positioning

Support skills are stage-context tools, not a second workflow:

- early design work: `/design-consultation`, `/plan-design-review`
- debugging: `/investigate`
- visual polish: `/design-review`
- maintainability polish: `/simplify`
- browser QA: `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/setup-browser-cookies`
- performance/security: `/benchmark`, `/cso`
- release tail: `/land`, `/deploy`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/document-release`, `/canary`, `/retro`, `/learn`

Do not present these as a flat tool menu unless the user asks for that explicitly.
Surface them when they materially help the current lifecycle stage.

## Important Boundaries

- `/nexus` is the workflow harness entrypoint, not the browser skill
- use `/browse` for direct browser work
- use `/discover` to start a new governed product/software run
- compatibility aliases like `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, and `/autoplan`
  are not primary entrypoints
- provider/transport details belong to bootstrap summary and blocked-route explanation, not to the
  main lifecycle narration
