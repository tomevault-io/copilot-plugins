## Architecture

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS (arm64 + simulator), and Desktop (JVM). The architecture enforces strict unidirectional layering — dependencies only flow downward:

```
Platform Apps (androidApp, desktopApp, iosApp/iosExport)
    ↓
core:ui, core:navigation          ← App composable, theme, NavigationSuiteScaffold, NavDisplay
    ↓
feature:posting:impl   feature:settings:impl   ← Screens, ViewModels, DI
    ↓  (via api module only)        ↓
feature:posting:api    feature:settings:api    ← NavKey sealed types only, no logic
    ↓
core:domain                       ← Use cases (one class per operation); SettingsRepository interface
    ↓
core:data            core:datastore            ← PostingRepository impl + mappers / DataStore-backed settings
    ↓
core:database                     ← Room 3 DAOs, entities, platform builders
```

Two repository implementations plug in at different boundaries: `PostingRepository` is **declared in `core:data`** and implemented there (`OfflineFirstPostingRepository`); `SettingsRepository` is **declared in `core:domain` (`repository/`)** and implemented in `core:datastore` (`DataStoreSettingsRepository`). Both flow only domain models upward.

Cross-cutting modules: `core:model` (pure domain types incl. `ThemeMode`), `core:common` (DataResult, logging), `core:compose` (shared UI components), `core:datastore` (DataStore-backed settings persistence), `core:bootstrap` (root Koin module), `core:test` (fakes, test utilities).

### Key Patterns

**DataResult + asResult()** — all async data in the UI layer flows through a sealed `DataResult<T>` (Loading / Success / Error). ViewModels call `flow.asResult()` and map to a sealed UI state (e.g. `PostingListUiState`). This pattern is in `core:common` and must be used consistently.

**Cancellation-safe result wrapping** — never use stdlib `runCatching` in suspend/coroutine code: it captures `CancellationException` and turns structured-concurrency cancellation into a spurious Error state. Use `runCatchingCancellable` from `core:common` (`result/RunCatchingCancellable.kt`) instead — a `suspend inline` helper (per kotlinx.coroutines#1814) that rethrows `CancellationException` and wraps every other `Throwable`. Applies to use cases and any one-shot suspend load.

**Feature API/Impl split** — `feature:posting:api` contains only `@Serializable` NavKey types. `feature:posting:impl` contains screens, ViewModels, and Koin DI. No other module may depend on `:impl`. Navigation between features goes through `:api` types only.

**Koin annotation-driven DI** — all dependencies use `@Module`, `@Factory`, `@Single`, `@KoinViewModel`. The Koin Compiler plugin (1.2.1) validates the graph at compile time **only at the `@KoinApplication` entry points** — `androidApp`, `desktopApp`, `iosExport` — where it assembles the full `BootstrapModule` closure. There is no per-module validation: a library module compiled on its own gets code generation but no diagnostics, so a wiring error surfaces when you build an app module, not the library that broke it. The per-module net is the runtime `verify()` tests (`core:bootstrap`, `feature:*:impl`). All three entry points have compile safety on; `desktopApp` needed `compileSafety = false` under plugin 1.1.0 for a `providerOnly` false positive (the removed workaround is still explained in its build file), fixed in 1.2.1. Never use Koin DSL for domain/data/database modules. DSL is sanctioned only in the feature `*NavigationModule`s (e.g. `postingNavigationModule`, `settingsNavigationModule`) for exactly two things: (1) Compose `navigation<NavKey>` screen entries, and (2) contributing each feature's top-level nav item via `single(named("<feature>_top_level")) { TopLevelDestination(...) }`. The `named()` qualifier keeps the two definitions on distinct keys, so `getAll<TopLevelDestination>()` aggregates them instead of one overriding the other. That is a deliberate DSL choice, not a limitation of the annotations: koin-annotations 4.2.2 **does** support multibinding — `@Named` is legal on a module function, and several `@Single @Named(...)` definitions of one type aggregate through the same `getAll()` the DSL generates underneath. These two stay in the DSL so each nav item sits beside the `navigation<NavKey>` entries it ships with, and loads with the nav modules passed at `startKoin` rather than joining the `BootstrapModule` closure. Only `navigation<NavKey>` has no annotation equivalent at all.

**Expect/Actual for platform database** — `PlatformDatabaseModule` is an `expect class` in `commonMain`. Each platform provides the `RoomDatabase.Builder<LedgerDatabase>` with OS-appropriate paths.

**Expect/Actual for platform DataStore** — settings persist via AndroidX **DataStore Preferences** in `core:datastore`. `PlatformDataStoreModule` is an `expect class` in `commonMain` with Android/iOS/JVM actuals that each supply the absolute file path for `ledger.preferences_pb` (JVM resolves the same OS-aware data dirs as the Room DB). The shared `createPreferencesDataStore` factory installs a `ReplaceFileCorruptionHandler` and `DataStoreSettingsRepository` recovers from read `IOException`s by emitting `emptyPreferences()`; an unknown/missing stored value falls back to `ThemeMode.SYSTEM`.

**Adaptive top-level navigation** — the app shell in `core:ui` (`App()`) renders a `NavigationSuiteScaffold` (bottom bar / rail / drawer by window size) wrapping `NavDisplay`. Each feature contributes its own `TopLevelDestination` (in `core:navigation`) through DI; the shell aggregates them with `getKoin().getAll<TopLevelDestination>().sortedBy { it.order }` and never references feature routes directly. `Navigator` holds **one `NavBackStack` per section** keyed by section root: `switchTopLevel` preserves each section's stack (re-selecting the current section resets it to root), and `goBack` is exit-through-home (pop within section, then fall back to the start section). Inactive sections keep their ViewModels/saved UI state alive via per-section entry decorators.

**Theme preference flow** — `App()` collects `GetThemeModeUseCase()` with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle(initialValue = ThemeMode.SYSTEM)` and wraps content in `LedgerTheme(themeMode)`, which resolves `SYSTEM` via `isSystemInDarkTheme()`. DataStore reads are async, so a cold start may briefly show the system theme before the stored preference loads.

**No mocking — fakes only** — `core:test` provides `FakePostingRepository`, a full in-memory implementation backed by `MutableStateFlow`. Unit tests use `UnconfinedTestDispatcher` set as the main dispatcher in `@BeforeTest`.

**Entities never cross layer boundaries** — DAOs return `PostingEntity`, mappers in `core:data` convert to `Posting`/`NewPosting` before returning. Domain models only flow upward.

### Navigation

Uses Navigation 3 (`androidx.navigation3`). Screens are registered as Koin entries using `navigation<NavKey>` DSL in each feature's `*NavigationModule` (e.g. `postingNavigationModule`, `settingsNavigationModule`). Screens obtain ViewModels via `koinViewModel()`. Navigation actions use `LocalNavigator.current` (a `CompositionLocal` wrapping a `Navigator` that manages the `NavBackStack`).

### Convention Plugins (build-logic)

Three composable Gradle plugins — modules declare one of these instead of configuring targets manually:
- `ledger.kotlin.multiplatform` — base KMP, JVM 21, kotlin-test, Kover
- `ledger.kotlin.multiplatform.koin` — adds Koin core, annotations, compiler plugin
- `ledger.kotlin.multiplatform.koin.compose` — adds Compose Multiplatform, resources, UI test, `core:test` dependency

### Tech Stack Versions

| Technology | Version |
|---|---|
| Kotlin | 2.4.0 |
| Compose Multiplatform | 1.12.0 |
| Koin | 4.2.2 |
| Room | 3.0.3 |
| Navigation 3 | 1.1.7 (runtime) / 1.1.1 (ui) |
| AndroidX DataStore | 1.2.1 |
| Coroutines | 1.11.0 |
| Kover | 0.9.9 |

Material3 and Material3 Adaptive are pinned to prerelease versions (`androidx-material3 = "1.12.0-alpha03"`, `androidx-adaptive = "1.3.0-beta02"`) on purpose: those are the exact coordinates Compose Multiplatform 1.12.0 declares itself aligned to. They are not debt to pay down, and moving either to a "stable" number would de-align the stack. Re-check the alignment table in the Compose Multiplatform release notes on every CM bump.

AGP is pinned to the version the bundled IntelliJ IDEA plugin supports (the reason is commented in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`), and that pin now carries an expiry. `./gradlew help --warning-mode all` reports 5 configuration-phase deprecations — *"Using a Project object as a dependency notation … will fail with an error in Gradle 10"* — every one attributed to `com.android.internal.*` and none to this repo's own build scripts, so there is nothing here to fix. It is a constraint instead: **do not move to Gradle 10 while AGP is held at the IDEA ceiling.** When IDEA raises its ceiling and AGP is bumped, re-run that command and confirm the count is zero before evaluating Gradle 10.

## Module Conventions

- Database entities live in `core:database`, never elsewhere.
- Settings persistence: the `SettingsRepository` interface lives in `core:domain` (`repository/`) and is implemented in `core:datastore` (`DataStoreSettingsRepository`) — unlike `PostingRepository`, whose interface lives in `core:data`. The DataStore file is `ledger.preferences_pb`, stored under the same OS-aware data directories as the Room database.
- Room migration posture (pre-release): `DatabaseModule.provideDatabase` uses `.fallbackToDestructiveMigration(dropAllTables = true)`, so bumping the `@Database` `version` on `LedgerDatabase` **drops and recreates all data**. Before shipping real user data, replace this with explicit `Migration` objects plus a CI check that the exported schema dir changed on the version bump.
- Use cases in `core:domain` each take exactly one repository method as their primary action.
- Compose stability is declared out-of-band in `compose_stability.conf` at the repo root, wired into every Compose module through `stabilityConfigurationFiles` in the `ledger.kotlin.multiplatform.koin.compose` convention plugin. It exists because `core:model` deliberately carries no Compose compiler plugin, so its types would otherwise reach consumers with no stability metadata and be inferred **unstable** — and strong skipping (default since Kotlin 2.0) then compares them by instance identity, which the Room-backed flow never preserves. The file asserts two invariants, and nothing checks them for you: everything under `app.oreshkov.ledger.core.model` stays an immutable `val`-only holder, and `List`s handed to composables are never mutated in place (they are declared `kotlin.collections.List<*>`, so a list is exactly as stable as its element type rather than blanket-stable). Verify a change with `javap -p -c` on a UI-state class: `$stable = 0` is stable, `8` is unstable. Editing the conf file does **not** invalidate the compile tasks, so re-measure with `--rerun-tasks`.
- Kover excludes generated classes automatically: `*ComposableSingletons*`, `*_Factory` (Koin), `*$serializer` (kotlinx.serialization), `*_Impl*` and `*DatabaseConstructor` (Room KSP), `app.oreshkov.ledger.*.resources.*`, `*.compose.resources.*`, `@Preview`-annotated methods. It also excludes `*.di.*` packages — DI wiring is validated by Koin `verify()`, not by execution, so it stays out of coverage — plus `MainKt` and `LedgerApp`, the desktop entry points, which by convention carry no logic. Room's exclusion **has** to be by name pattern: its output carries `@javax.annotation.processing.Generated`, which is `@Retention(SOURCE)` and so absent from the bytecode Kover reads, making `annotatedBy("*Generated*")` useless against it. Room codegen was 237 of 860 lines — 27.6% — of the aggregate before it was excluded, and ~96% of `core:database`'s own report. The resources pattern is tied to the `packageOfResClass` convention below — if a module picks a package outside `app.oreshkov.ledger.*.resources`, its generated `Res` class silently re-enters coverage. **Keep this list in sync with the copy in the `ledger.kotlin.multiplatform` convention plugin**, which drives the per-module reports; the root build and a precompiled script plugin cannot share a constant.
- `:desktopApp` is in the root `kover(project(...))` list even though it is an app module, and that is deliberate. `DesktopUiTest` boots the real `App()` over a real in-memory Room database, DataStore, Koin graph and `NavDisplay`, and it already runs on every `check`; without that entry Kover discards its execution data and credits none of the library code it exercises — it is worth +1.1 pp line and +5.0 pp branch on the aggregate. Do not drop it. Do **not** add `:androidApp`: its `androidTest` needs an emulator and never runs in CI, so it would only add uncovered lines.
- **Coverage is JVM-only, by construction.** Kover instruments JVM bytecode, so `jvmTest` and `testAndroidHostTest` are the only measured source sets. `core:database`'s `iosTest` runs real tests on `iosArm64`/`iosSimulatorArm64` and none of it is measured, and every `iosMain` `actual` (`PlatformDatabaseModule.ios`, `PlatformDataStoreModule.ios`, `PlatformLogWriter.ios`, `MainViewController`) is permanently invisible to the report. That is a Kover limitation, not a gap to close — do not try to "fix" it.
- The aggregate **branch** floor stays well below the line/instruction floors on purpose, and this is measured, not folklore: adding `annotatedBy("androidx.compose.runtime.Composable")` to the report filters takes branch coverage from 77.20% (237/307) to 94.55% (104/110). 64% of the report's branches are Compose compiler `$changed`/`$default` bitmask plumbing, which re-shapes on every Compose compiler bump. `@Composable` is `AnnotationRetention.BINARY`, so `annotatedBy` can see it — run that as a one-off diagnostic when the branch number looks wrong, but never ship it as a filter: it also deletes the composable content the UI tests genuinely exercise (145 lines when last measured). Raise the line floor instead; do not chase aggregate branch.
- Every module that generates a Compose `Res` class pins `packageOfResClass` explicitly in its own `build.gradle.kts`, as `app.oreshkov.ledger.<module path>.resources` (`:iosExport` → `app.oreshkov.ledger.iosexport.resources`). The Compose default is `{group}.{module}.generated.resources`, which — with no `group` set — derives from `rootProject.name`, so renaming the root project would silently repackage every module's accessors. `Res` stays internal (`publicResClass` defaults to `false`); only `core:compose` sets `publicResClass = true`, because its `back_content_description` string is consumed by the feature modules. A `Res` class is generated in any module with an explicit `implementation`/`api` dependency on `compose.components.resources` — which the `ledger.kotlin.multiplatform.koin.compose` convention plugin adds — so modules with no `composeResources/` directory (`core:bootstrap`, `core:navigation`, `core:ui`, `iosExport`) still get an empty one and still need the pin. The generated accessors surface in the klib API dumps, so changing a package requires `./gradlew apiDump`.
- iOS entry point (`iosExport`) uses Swift Export (Alpha as of Kotlin 2.4.0, direct Kotlin→Swift, no Objective-C bridging; the DSL is still gated behind `@OptIn(ExperimentalSwiftExportDsl)`). Swift calls `initializeKoin()` before `MainViewController`.
- Binary-compatibility-validator guards every module's public API. `check` runs `apiCheck` (both `jvmApiCheck` and `klibApiCheck`) against the committed dumps in `<module>/api/`, so **changing a public API fails CI until you run `./gradlew apiDump` and commit the updated `*/api/` files** alongside the code change. No public API change → no action needed.
