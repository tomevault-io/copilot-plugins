# Agent Guide for meta-qcom

This file guides automation agents to run builds / checks the same way CI does:

- use **kas-container** (isolated from host),
- keep `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR` outside the repo so caches are shared,
- run `yocto-patchreview` and `oe-selftest` routinely, and run
  `yocto-check-layer` before opening/updating a PR, via the CI helper scripts.

## Project Overview

meta-qcom is an OpenEmbedded / Yocto Project hardware enablement layer for Qualcomm based platforms.

## Agent skills

Reusable agent skills for the qualcomm-linux projects are maintained in
[qcom-linux-skills](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/qcom-linux-skills),
in the `SKILL.md` format understood by Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and
similar agents. Several of them cover the workflows described in this file,
such as `qcom-yocto-build-image` (build images with kas-container),
`qcom-yocto-pre-pr-checks` (the CI-parity checks from section 4),
`qcom-yocto-update-base-lock` (refresh `ci/base.lock.yml`), and
`qcom-flash-qdl` / `qcom-boot-validate` (flash and boot-test a board).
Install them with the repository's `install.sh` and prefer an existing
skill over re-deriving the workflow; improvements go back to that catalog.

## 1) Prerequisites

1. `kas-container` available on PATH, or set `KAS_CONTAINER=/abs/path/to/kas-container`
   (from [kas-container](https://github.com/siemens/kas/blob/master/kas-container)).
2. Container runtime access (Docker/Podman backend used by `kas-container`).
3. Work directories outside the repository for build outputs and shared caches.

### Container runtime smoke test

`kas-container` uses Docker when it is installed and falls back to Podman
otherwise (set `KAS_CONTAINER_ENGINE` to override), so check the engine it
will pick:

```sh
docker run --rm hello-world    # or, on a Podman-only host: podman run --rm hello-world
```

Notes:

- Do not use `sudo` unless the host setup explicitly requires it.
- Do not create or modify user groups as part of this workflow.

## 2) Recommended environment

If `KAS_WORK_DIR`, `DL_DIR`, and `SSTATE_DIR` are already set in the environment, use them
directly — do not override them. Only set defaults when they are absent:

```sh
export REPO_DIR="$(pwd)"                               # meta-qcom checkout
export KAS_WORK_DIR="${KAS_WORK_DIR:-/path/to/kas-work}"      # outside repo to avoid polling the checkout
export DL_DIR="${DL_DIR:-/path/to/shared-cache/downloads}"
export SSTATE_DIR="${SSTATE_DIR:-/path/to/shared-cache/sstate-cache}"
mkdir -p "${DL_DIR}" "${SSTATE_DIR}" "${KAS_WORK_DIR}"
```

## 3) Build with kas-container (CI style)

CI build composition pattern:
`ci/<machine>.yml[:ci/<distro>.yml][:ci/<kernel>.yml]`

Example:

```sh
export KAS_YAMLS="ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml:ci/qcom-distro.yml"
"${KAS_CONTAINER:-kas-container}" build "${KAS_YAMLS}"
```

## 4) Run routine checks via CI helper scripts

For routine local validation, run:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-patchreview.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/oe-selftest.sh
```

Run `yocto-check-layer` only before opening/updating a pull request:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-check-layer.sh
```

### oe-selftest details

- Script: `ci/oe-selftest.sh`
- Auto-discovers tests in `lib/oeqa/selftest/cases/` when no test list is given.
- Honors `DL_DIR` and `SSTATE_DIR` from environment (recommended for shared cache).

Run a subset:

```sh
"${KAS_CONTAINER:-kas-container}" shell ci/base.yml \
  --command "/repo/ci/oe-selftest.sh /repo /work qcom_fitimage.QcomFitImageMatrixTests"
```

## 5) Direct kas shell alternative (no helper wrapper)

For one-off commands:

```sh
kas-container shell --skip repos_checkout ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml -c "bitbake <target>"
kas-container shell --skip repos_checkout ci/rb3gen2-core-kit.yml -c "oe-selftest --run-tests qcom_fitimage"
```

Use the helper scripts for CI parity whenever possible.

## 6) Pull request / contribution workflow

Changes reach `qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom` as GitHub pull requests against
**master**, from a topic branch in a fork that is rebased on the latest
upstream `master`; review iterates in the pull request discussion. Commit
requirements are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (see section 7).

Open a pull request, backports included, only when the user asks for one.
Every pull request lands in the maintainers' review queue, so one the user
did not ask for, or does not know about, is review load nobody wanted.
Otherwise, stop once the change is committed and tell the user it is ready.

Before opening/updating a PR, run CI-equivalent checks in this order:

```sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-patchreview.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/yocto-check-layer.sh
ci/kas-container-shell-helper.sh ci/oe-selftest.sh
```

## 7) Commit message best practices (project style)

Follow the commit subject and message requirements documented in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): an atomic change per commit, a
`recipe-name: summary of the changes` subject, a plain-English body that
explains the problem before the imperative actions, and the mandatory
`Signed-off-by` (and, when applicable, `Assisted-by`) trailers.

When committing programmatically, take the `Signed-off-by` identity from the
local git configuration and append the trailer explicitly:

```text
Signed-off-by: $(git config user.name) <$(git config user.email)>
```

Never fabricate a name or email; always read them from `git config`.

Trailer order matters: `Assisted-by` goes **before** `Signed-off-by`, so the
sign-off is always the last trailer written by the author. A complete
agent-assisted commit message, at a typical length, looks like this:

```text
ci/performance: enable root-only udev trigger

The initramfs udev framework now supports root-only triggering for all
supported initramfs images and falls back to a full trigger when the
root device cannot be resolved.

Enable the optimization unconditionally in the performance command line
instead of limiting it to initramfs-rootfs-image.

Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION
Signed-off-by: Author Name <author@example.com>
```

Do not append `Assisted-by` after `Signed-off-by` (for example with
`git commit -s` followed by `git interpret-trailers --trailer Assisted-by=...`);
write both trailers in the order above in a single commit message instead.

Fixups within the same patch series are not allowed; changes should be
corrected in the patch where they are introduced.

### Writing for reviewers

Commit messages, code comments and pull request descriptions are read by
maintainers reviewing many changes, so keep them short enough to take in
at a glance. A commit body is usually one or two short paragraphs: the
problem, the change, and any fact the reviewer cannot get from the diff.
Leave out what the diff already shows, the alternatives you considered,
and what the change does not affect, unless a reviewer would otherwise
ask. Get there by saying less, not by compressing it into fragments.

Comment code the way the surrounding file does, and only where the reason
is not obvious; how the code changed belongs in the commit message.

## 8) Backporting to a release branch

Fixes land on `master` first and are then backported to the release branch
(currently `wrynose`). Merged pull requests labelled `backport wrynose` are
backported automatically by `.github/workflows/backport.yml`; when a manual
backport is needed (conflicts, or a change that only applies to the release
branch), follow the same conventions the automation uses:

1. Create a topic branch from the latest release branch, for example
   `backport/<pr-number>-to-wrynose`.
2. Cherry-pick the original commits with `git cherry-pick -x <sha>`, which
   appends the `(cherry picked from commit <sha>)` line for you. Keep the
   original subject, body, and trailers unchanged, and add your own
   `Signed-off-by` after the cherry-pick line if it is not already present.
3. When the user asks for the pull request, open it against the release
   branch with the subject prefixed by the target branch, for example
   `[Backport wrynose] recipe-name: summary of the changes`, and link the
   original pull request in the description.

The `[Backport <branch>]` prefix belongs to the pull request subject only.
The commits themselves are normal patches whose only backport marker is the
`(cherry picked from commit ...)` line; never add the prefix to a commit
subject.
