## Examples

```bash
✨ feat(player): add sleep timer functionality
🐛 fix(scanner): handle permission denied on Android 14
📝 docs(readme): add app icon
♻️ refactor(bloc): migrate to sealed class events
⚡ perf(database): optimize query performance
✅ test(player): add unit tests for playback
🔧 chore(config): update analysis options
👷 ci(workflow): use latest stable Flutter
⬆️ deps: upgrade flutter_bloc to v9.2.0
🔥 remove(legacy): delete deprecated widgets
🚚 move(scripts): relocate PowerShell scripts
```

## Branch Strategy

- All development work goes to `develop` branch
- Only merge to `main` when features are stable and tested
- Use feature branches for larger changes: `feature/<name>`
- Use fix branches for bug fixes: `fix/<name>`

## Workflow

1. Always commit to `develop` branch during development
2. Test thoroughly on `develop`
3. When ready for release, merge `develop` into `main`
4. Tag releases on `main` branch (e.g., `v0.1.0`)
