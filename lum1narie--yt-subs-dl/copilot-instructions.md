# Gemini Agent Context: yt_subs_dl

## Project Overview

This project, `yt_subs_dl`, is a Python-based command-line tool
for downloading and formatting subtitles from YouTube videos.
It extracts subtitle text, merges segments,
and intelligently adds newlines based on pause durations.
It also handles language-specific text formatting.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Environment Management:** Nix Flakes
- **Core Libraries:**
  - `yt-dlp`: For downloading video metadata and subtitles.
  - `requests`: (Included in the environment, available for use).

## Code Rule

- Type annotations is always required.
- Docstring
  - Always include Arguments, Returns, and Exceptions in function documentation
    if exists.
    - Also describe any unpredictable behavior
      that may arise from the overview.
- Strive to keep every line of code and documentation within 80
  characters whenever possible. If allowed by context or grammar, use
  line breaks to meet the character limit.

## gemini-cli Chat Rule

- The AI of `gemini-cli` must respond in the same language as the
  user's prompt.
  - Therefore, please think according to the following steps:
    1. First, internally translate the user's prompt into English.
    1. When Answering:
       1. Internally prepare the response in English.
       1. Finally, translate the response into the user's prompt
          language and display it.

## Development Environment

The development environment is fully managed by Nix to ensure
reproducibility.

1. **Setup:** Run `nix develop` in the project root. This command will
   install all necessary dependencies, including Python and the
   required packages, into a temporary shell.
1. **Execution:** All development commands, including running the
   script, should be executed within this shell.

## Key Files

- **`yt_subs_dl.py`**: The main entry point and application logic.
- **`flake.nix`**: Defines the Nix Flake, including all Python dependencies.
  To add or update packages, modify the `buildInputs` list in this file.
- **`README.md`**: User-facing documentation with usage instructions.

## Development Workflow

- **Running the script:**

  ```bash
  nix run .#default "<YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL>"
  ```

- **Adding Dependencies:** Edit the `buildInputs` list in `flake.nix`
  and re-run `nix develop` to update the environment.
  - Also add dependecies to `requirements.txt` for compatibility with `pip`.

### Development AI Rule

- Testing
  - Add test in `./tests` diretctories if you make new function.
  - Never change the things already exists in `./tests`.
    - Only unless the function specification change is directly
      requested in the prompt.
- Language
  - Write comments and documentations in **English**.
- Document
  - If you make changes that affect users, update `README.md`.
  - If you define new types or functions, write documentation.
- Git
  - Never try to run the `git` command unless the user directly
    requests the execution of a git command in the prompt.
  - You are not required to generate a commit message unless the
    user directly requests it.
  - When requested to think about git commit messages, if the
    current staged content contains multiple contexts, please also
    suggest how to split them.
    - However, if there are both staged and unstaged changes
      within the same file, there is no need to split them.

### Testing and Linting

The development environment includes `pytest` for testing and `ruff` for
linting and formatting.

- **Testing (pytest):**

  ```bash
  nix run .#test
  ```

- **Linting & Formatting (Ruff):**

  ```bash
  # To check for issues:
  nix run .#lint
  # To format code:
  nix run .#format-py
  ```

- **Check compatibility with pip:**

  ```bash
  nix run .#run-from-requirements-install
  ```

- **Formatting (Others):**

  ```bash
  # Format nix files:
  nix fmt **/*.nix
  ```

### Runtime Arguments Rules

- If you need a URL argument to test the functionality,
  use "<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGMTguMGPt0>"

## Commit Rule

- This project uses gitflow.
- This project uses gitmoji.
- Commit message must be in English.
- Commit title format: `<type>: <emoji>(<context>) <body>`
  (e.g., 'refactor: :recycle:(backend) split `calc_fraction()` into
  multiple functions')
  - Select one of emoji from the list below apppropriate to show
    context of the commit.
    - Refer `kind` of emoji.
  - `<type>`: Commit type (e.g., fix, feat, docs). `type` column in
    the table.
    - Must match one of the IDs from the emoji list.
  - `<emoji>`: The emoji, `emoji` column in the table, written as a
    string enclosed in double colons (e.g., `:bug:`, `:sparkles:`,
    `:books:`, `:rocket:`), NOT as a Unicode emoji.
    - When writing the emoji. always use the double colon notation
      (e.g., `:sparkles:`), not the Unicode emoji symbol.
      - For instance, write `:sparkles:` instead of ✨.
  - `<context>`: The context of the commit, representing an
    externally visible unit, such as a module or issue number (e.g.,
    `main`, `reader`, `fix: #1234`, `docs: #1234`).
    - `(<context>)` is optional, including the parentheses.
    - Avoid using code-specific units like function names or class
      names as context.
    - If the change type is broad or affects multiple areas, omit
      the context.
  - `<body>`: The description of commit.
    (e.g. `add function to calculate the length of meridian line`)
- Optionally, include a commit body for:
  - Details on what was changed.
  - Explanation of why the change was made.
- If you make commit body, please separate it from the title with line
  break.

### Conditions of the sentence of commit message

- Use universally understandable abbreviations.
- Keep titles under 80 characters, ideally under 50 unless necessary.
- Limit the body to 300 characters (5 lines).
  - Each line is under 80 characters.
  - Each paragraph is separated by a blank line.
  - Without counting the blank lines.

### gitmojis

The meaning of row:

- `type`, `emoji`: as above
- `description`: The description of emoji.
- `kind`: The category of emoji.
- `utf8`: emoji in utf8 format.
