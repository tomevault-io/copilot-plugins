# pai-collab — Agent Operating Protocol

You are working in pai-collab, a shared blackboard for PAI community collaboration. Follow these protocols whenever you work in this repository.

---

## Self-Alignment Check (MANDATORY)

**After every policy change, issue closure, or SOP modification**, review this file against the current state of all policy documents and SOPs:

1. Read `TRUST-MODEL.md`, all files in `sops/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `REGISTRY.md`
2. Check whether this file (CLAUDE.md) accurately reflects the current procedures, trust zones, and protocols
3. If any procedure has changed, update this file to match
4. If this file references an SOP or policy that has been modified, align the reference

**This file is the codified version of the standard operating procedures.** If an SOP says one thing and this file says another, that is a bug. Fix it immediately.

**The cascade works both ways:**
- Policy/SOP change → check this file → update if misaligned
- This file change → check policies/SOPs → update if misaligned

---

## Artifact Schemas (MANDATORY)

All artifacts in this repository follow canonical schemas defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. When creating or modifying any artifact, follow the schema exactly.

| Artifact | Schema Location | Triggers for Update |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| `PROJECT.yaml` | CONTRIBUTING.md → "PROJECT.yaml Schema" | Creating a new project, changing project status, adding contributors |
| `JOURNAL.md` (project) | CONTRIBUTING.md → "JOURNAL.md Schema" | After every commit that changes project files, after actioning a project issue |
| `JOURNAL.md` (root) | CONTRIBUTING.md → "JOURNAL.md Schema" | After every commit that changes governance files, after actioning a governance issue |
| Project `README.md` | CONTRIBUTING.md → "Project README.md — Minimum Content" | Creating a new project, significant project milestone |
| `REGISTRY.md` entries | CONTRIBUTING.md → "REGISTRY.md Entry Format" | New project registered, project status changes, new agent joins |
| `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` | TRUST-MODEL.md → "Two-Level Scoping" | New contributor promoted, trust zone changed, profile updated |
| `STATUS.md` | — (root-level project overview) | New project added, project phase changes, contributor promoted or added |
| SOPs | CONTRIBUTING.md → "SOP Format Guide" | Creating or modifying an SOP |
| Governance reviews | `reviews/README.md` | Trust model audits, documentation audits, cross-project reviews |

**Key rules:**
- `PROJECT.yaml` status must use canonical lifecycle values: `proposed`, `building`, `hardening`, `contrib-prep`, `review`, `shipped`, `evolving`, `archived`
- **Repository license is AGPL-3.0.** All contributions to pai-collab (SOPs, governance docs, tooling) are under AGPL-3.0. PRs constitute acceptance of this license (DCO model — see CONTRIBUTING.md)
- `PROJECT.yaml` must include a `license` field with an accepted SPDX identifier: `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `BSD-2-Clause`, `BSD-3-Clause`, `CC-BY-4.0`, `AGPL-3.0`. CC-BY-4.0 is accepted for documentation/specification projects. AGPL-3.0 is accepted for infrastructure tooling where network-use protection is required (prevents cloud extraction without contribution). Reject PRs that omit this field or use other copyleft licenses (GPL, LGPL, MPL)
- `REGISTRY.md` status must match `PROJECT.yaml` status — REGISTRY.md is the index, PROJECT.yaml is the source of truth
- `JOURNAL.md` phase values must match the lifecycle: Specify, Build, Harden, Contrib Prep, Review, Release, Evolve
- When a project's status changes, update `PROJECT.yaml`, `REGISTRY.md`, AND `STATUS.md` in the same commit

---

## Journaling Protocol

**After every commit**, update the relevant `JOURNAL.md` following the schema in CONTRIBUTING.md:
- Add a new entry at the top (reverse chronological)
- Required fields: date, author, phase, status, what happened, what emerged
- Include issue references and what follow-up was created
- If a commit spans multiple projects, update each project's journal
- Each entry must be self-contained — readable without context from other entries

**Where to journal:**
- **Project-specific changes** → that project's `JOURNAL.md` (e.g., `projects/signal/JOURNAL.md`)
- **Governance changes** (SOPs, TRUST-MODEL.md, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, STATUS.md, CONTRIBUTORS.yaml) → `JOURNAL.md` at the repo root

**After actioning an issue**, add a journal entry documenting what happened and what emerged — not just the change, but the reasoning and any insights. This applies to both project and governance issues.

---

## Issue Protocol

**All non-trivial changes must be tracked by an issue.** Issues are the unit of traceability — they connect intent (why), scope (what), and evidence (commits, journal entries). Without an issue, work is invisible to other agents and contributors.

### Issue-First Workflow

1. **Before starting work** — Ensure an issue exists. If not, create one.
2. **Label the issue** — Apply scope, type, and priority labels (see below).
3. **Comment that you're working on it** — So other agents don't duplicate effort.
4. **Commit with references** — Use `closes #N` or `partial #N` in commit messages.
5. **Push to remote** — Push after each completed unit of work. Other agents and the issue tracker depend on commits being visible on the remote.
6. **Update the journal** — After closing an issue, add a journal entry to the relevant project. If it's a `governance` issue, journal in the most relevant project or note it in the commit.
7. **Create follow-up issues immediately** — When work reveals new needs, don't batch them. Each issue is atomic.

### Issue Title Convention

Issue titles must use a scope prefix to group related issues when sorted by name:

```
<scope>: <subject>
```

| Prefix | When |
|--------|------|
| `signal:` | Signal project |
| `pai-secret-scanning:` | pai-secret-scanning project |
| `specflow-lifecycle:` | specflow-lifecycle project |
| `skill-enforcer:` | skill-enforcer project |
| `governance:` | Repo-level policy, trust model, SOPs, process, onboarding |

The prefix must match the project directory name in `projects/`. For new projects, use the directory name as the prefix. This complements scope labels — labels enable filtering, prefixes enable scanning.

### Retroactive Issues

If you realise work was done without an issue, create one retroactively and close it with a reference to the commit(s). Gaps in traceability compound — fix them as soon as you notice.

### Issue Labelling

Every issue must have labels from these categories:

| Category | Labels | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Scope** | `project/signal`, `project/pai-secret-scanning`, `project/specflow-lifecycle`, `project/collab-infra`, `governance` | What area — a specific project or the repo-level system |
| **Type** | `type/task`, `type/idea`, `type/review`, `type/tooling`, `type/governance`, `type/introduction` | What kind of work |
| **Priority** | `P1-high`, `P2-medium`, `P3-low` | When to do it |
| **Cross-cutting** | `security`, `trust`, `upstream-contribution`, `seeking-contributors` | Functional tags |
| **Collaboration** | `parallel-review`, `competing-proposals` | Multiple contributors sought on the same topic |

- Every issue needs at least one **scope** label — this links the issue to the repo structure
- `governance` is for repo-level policy, trust model, SOPs, and process — not tied to a single project
- `seeking-contributors` is the primary label for requesting any kind of help — reviews, expertise, implementation, second opinions. Use it alone or alongside `parallel-review` or `competing-proposals` to specify the collaboration pattern
- `parallel-review` invites multiple independent reviews — reviewers submit separately, maintainer synthesizes
- `competing-proposals` invites multiple approaches to the same problem — propose your solution, maintainer selects or merges

### Scope Label Lifecycle

When a new `projects/` directory is created, a corresponding `project/<name>` label must also be created. When creating or updating issues:

1. **Determine scope** — Does this issue relate to a specific project in `projects/`? If yes, use `project/<name>`. If it's repo-level (policy, SOPs, trust model, schemas, onboarding), use `governance`.
2. **Check label exists** — If the `project/<name>` label doesn't exist yet, create it before applying.
3. **Keep labels aligned** — When a project is renamed or archived, update or retire its label. For archived projects, delete the `project/<name>` scope label per `sops/project-archival.md`.
4. **One scope minimum** — Never create an issue without a scope label. An unscoped issue is invisible to agents filtering by area.

## Trust Model Compliance

Before reviewing external PRs or loading external content, check the trust model:

1. Read `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` for the contributor's repo-level trust zone
2. Read the relevant `PROJECT.yaml` for project-level trust
3. Apply review intensity based on trust zone:
   - **Untrusted**: Full content scanning, tool restrictions, detailed audit logging
   - **Trusted**: Standard review, Layers 1–3 apply
   - **Maintainer**: Standard review, governance authority

Reference: `TRUST-MODEL.md` for the full threat model and defense layers.

Trust zones control **authority** (what you can decide), not **immunity** (what you skip). Nobody is exempt from scanning.

### Commit Signing & Identity

All commits must be signed with the operator's Ed25519 SSH key. This is enforced by CI (Gate 1: Identity) on every PR. The trust anchor is `.hive/allowed-signers` — changes to this file require maintainer review. See `sops/agent-onboarding.md` for setup and `TRUST-MODEL.md` for context.

---

## SOP Compliance

SOPs use **tiered loading** — read Foundation documents on arrival, load workflow SOPs on demand when performing that specific workflow. This reduces onboarding friction without losing the trust boundary.

### Foundation (always read — the trust boundary)

These documents define the rules you operate within. Read them before any interaction:

| Document | Why |
|----------|-----|
| This file (`CLAUDE.md`) | Agent operating protocol — journaling, issue-first, schemas |
| `TRUST-MODEL.md` | Trust zones, defense layers, threat vectors |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Start Here" | Reading order, contribution types, artifact schemas |

### First Contribution (read before your first PR)

| Document | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `sops/agent-onboarding.md` | Full onboarding pipeline — identity, reflexes, discovery |
| `sops/contribution-protocol.md` | How to prepare and submit work |

### Workflow SOPs (load on demand)

Read the relevant SOP **when** you need to perform that workflow — not upfront:

| When | SOP |
|------|-----|
| Processing an external PR | `sops/inbound-contribution-protocol.md` |
| Inviting multiple independent reviews | `sops/parallel-reviews.md` |
| Inviting competing approaches | `sops/competing-proposals.md` |
| Requesting help from community | `sops/requesting-collaboration.md` |
| Reviewing contributions | `sops/review-format.md` |
| Building features | `sops/specflow-development-pipeline.md` |
| Releasing to upstream | `sops/specfirst-release-process.md` |
| Registering agents | `sops/daemon-registry-protocol.md` |
| Coordinating cross-project work | `sops/iteration-planning.md` |
| Retiring a project | `sops/project-archival.md` |
| Setting up or publishing a spoke | `sops/spoke-operations.md` |

---

## Policy Change Protocol

When modifying policy documents (`TRUST-MODEL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, SOPs, this file), check for downstream impact:

1. **TRUST-MODEL.md changes** → Review whether SOPs need updating (especially contribution-protocol.md and review-format.md). Check whether this file (CLAUDE.md) needs updating.
2. **SOP changes** → Review whether TRUST-MODEL.md or CONTRIBUTING.md references need updating. Check whether this file reflects the new procedure.
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md changes** → Review whether REGISTRY.md "How to Join" and SOPs README cross-references are still accurate.
4. **This file (CLAUDE.md) changes** → Verify alignment with all SOPs and policy documents. This file is not a leaf node — it is the codified version of procedures and must stay in sync.

After any policy change, add a journal entry in the most relevant project explaining what changed and why.

---

## Communication Protocol

### After completing significant work:
- Draft a Discord summary for the maintainer to post
- Include: what was done, what emerged, what follow-up was created
- Keep it concise — the journal has the detail

### When you need help (requesting collaboration):

If you encounter a gap during work — need a security reviewer, domain expertise, a second opinion, or implementation help — follow `sops/requesting-collaboration.md`:

1. **Label the issue** — Add `seeking-contributors` (optionally with `parallel-review` or `competing-proposals` for specific patterns)
2. **Scope the request** — Update the issue with: what you need, what the helper needs to know, expected deliverable
3. **Draft a Discord broadcast** for the maintainer:
   ```
   🤝 Collaboration request on pai-collab

   Need: [review / expertise / implementation / second opinion]
   Issue: #N — [title]
   Context: [1-2 sentences]
   How to help: [specific action they can take]
   ```
4. **Track responses** — Monitor the issue, respond promptly to helpers, acknowledge contributions

## Key Principles

1. **Follow the schemas** — Every artifact has a canonical schema in CONTRIBUTING.md. Follow it exactly.
2. **Journal everything** — If it's not journaled, it didn't happen
3. **Issues are the work queue** — Create issues, action issues, close issues
4. **Keep artifacts in sync** — When status changes, update PROJECT.yaml AND REGISTRY.md together
5. **Trust is earned** — All contributors start untrusted. Zones control authority, not immunity.
6. **Policy changes cascade** — Check downstream documents when modifying policy
7. **Transparency builds trust** — Announce significant work to the community
